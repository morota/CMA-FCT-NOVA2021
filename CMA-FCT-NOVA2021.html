<h3>Course description</h3>
This course will cover quantitative genetic analysis of complex trait genomics with an emphasis on image-derived high-throughput phenotyping data.
The advent of plant phenomics, coupled with the wealth of genotypic
data generated by next-generation sequencing technologies, provides
exciting new resources for investigations into and improvement of
complex traits. However, these new technologies also bring new
challenges in quantitative genetics, namely, a need for the
development of robust frameworks that can accommodate these
high-dimensional data. We will discuss statistical methodologies for connecting phenotypes with high-dimensional genomic information to better understand polygenic traits from prediction and inference
perspectives. Topics will include phenotyping, genomic relatedness,
linkage disequilibrium, population stratification, genomic
heritability, genome-wide association study, genomic prediction,
causal inference, and statistical learning. We will use examples from
the plant and animal genetics literature.

This is a two-day course. Each day will include lectures, hands-on
data analysis sessions, and class discussions. Hands-on sessions will
involve the data analysis of simulated and real genomic data available
in public repositories. The course will use R/RStudio and Julia for
statistical computing tools. The course is aimed at students,
researchers, and professionals interested in the quantitative genetic
analysis of high-throughput phenotyping data. Some basic understanding
of genetics, statistics, and programming will be beneficial.
